Challenges

I have encountered many challenges with building this website. I have used a combination of tutor support, and going back over my notes and as a last resort AI has helpped with trouble shooting.

Final Thoughts
I have learnt a great deal from doing this website, with still a great deal to learn. I have enjoyed the process of being left to work it out for myself.

Chat GPT has helped with trouble shooting snippets of code.
I have also copied code from bootstrap library. 

Future Improvements
I would like to spend more time planning and having a clearer vision of the colour scheme prior to starting my project. If I was to continue on with this project I would like to add the features above and also get user feedback before adapting the design and content as needed.
